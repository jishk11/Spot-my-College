## About
Finding the right college is often a chaotic process of juggling stats, application info, locations, tuition, and campus vibes. **Spot my College** was built to centralize this data into a mobile-first experience, acting as a lens to top US universities. 

The app provided students with a visual and data-driven way to explore potential schools, combining hard stats (acceptance rates, SAT ranges) with soft factors (campus imagery, local environment).

## Key Features
* **Interactive Campus Maps:** Users can locate universities on a map and zoom in to see specific dorms, lecture halls, libraries, and nearby amenities (restaurants, stores, parks) to gauge the campus lifestyle.
* **Deep-Dive Metrics:** Detailed views for each institution, including:
    * Acceptance Rates & SAT/ACT score ranges.
    * Most popular majors and overall school ratings.
    * Tuition and Fees
    * School history and descriptions.
* **Visual Discovery:** curated imagery of famous campus buildings and landmarks.
* **Application Integration:** Direct links to school application portals.
